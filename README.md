# Front-End Developer Challenge

At Towoo we believe design is a collaborative process between designer and developer. This goal of this task is to assess your technical skills as a developer, but also your skill to think creatively and express your own ideas through design and code.

* Use any online resources you see fit.
* Remember, sketches are just sketches.
* Use your CSS framework of choice, or go fully custom.
* Use included vue-cli project structure.

## Situation of Concern

A restaurant is having trouble deciding on menu items and understanding the wants of their customers.

## Proposed Solution

An application that allows customers at a restaurant to vote on new menu items.

## Your task

Implement a simple proof-of-concept Vue.js application based on the sketches provided. Do your best to showcase your strengths and prioritise as you see fit. Don't be afraid to think outside the box; show your creativity.

## Resources

Images and design sketches are located in the `resources` folder. Colours are in a comment in src/App.css.

### Bonus Points

The restaurant is also using Tilde, feel free to incorporate some metadata from the following API endpoint: https://api.towoo.io/v1/events/678?include=images
